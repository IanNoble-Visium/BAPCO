### BAPCO TruContext Demo Dashboard Overview

#### Executive Summary
The TruContext demo dashboard for BAPCO integrates AI-driven analytics with real-time visualizations to address mature field challenges, refinery modernization, operational risks, and ESG compliance. Targeting lateral lift optimization and refinery stability, it simulates enhanced recovery (2-5% uplift), reduced downtime (30-50%), and emissions monitoring. Built as an interactive web app with video game-like 3D animations of machinery (e.g., ESPs, distillation towers), it uses digital twins for immersive operator experiences. Expected demo outcomes: showcase predictive maintenance, cyber-physical security, and end-to-end visibility aligned with Bahrain Vision 2030.




#### Key Challenges and TruContext Solutions
| Challenge | TruContext Solution | Expected Impact |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Declining recovery in mature fields | AI-optimized lateral well placement and artificial lift parameters via multi-source data integration | 2-5% recovery uplift; iterative model updates with production feedback |
| Refinery feedstock stability during modernization | Real-time control loops: sensors → AI → automated setpoints → operator validation | Improved throughput/yield; reduced margin volatility |
| Equipment failures and safety incidents | Predictive maintenance for ESPs/rod pumps; vibration/temperature monitoring | 30-50% failure reduction; automated alerts for hazards |
| Cyber-physical threats | Unified IT/OT monitoring; anomaly detection in SCADA/DCS | Rapid incident timelines; protection of ESD/SIS systems |
| Emissions and regulatory reporting | Air quality sensors for NOx/SOx/VOC; flaring quantification | Automated Scope 1/2 dashboards; integration with Bahrain frameworks |

#### Core Dashboard Features
- **Unified Context Graph**: Combines SCADA, IIoT sensors, historians, EAM/CMMS, and MES data into a graph database for holistic views.



- **AI Analytics Layer**: Predictive modeling, anomaly detection (e.g., sand production, gas lock), and prescriptive recommendations.
- **Role-Based Access**: Encrypted logs, audit trails, and RBAC for data sovereignty.
- **Scalability**: Phase-based rollout: pilot wells → full refinery integration.
- **Integration Points**: DCS for refinery units; edge sensors for downhole gauges, flow/pressure, vibrations.

#### Key Metrics and Visualizations
Monitor refinery operations (post-BMP: 380k-405k bpd capacity) with interactive elements. Use tools like Grafana/Power BI for base, enhanced with WebGL for 3D animations.

| Metric Category | Key Parameters | Visualization Type | Animation/Interaction |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Process Parameters | Temperature, pressure, flow rates in distillation towers/reactors/pipelines | Gauges, line charts for trends; heatmaps for alerts | 3D animated flow simulations (e.g., crude through Resid Hydrocracking unit) |
| Equipment Health | Vibration, energy consumption from pumps/compressors/valves; RUL for motors/turbines | Bar graphs, predictive failure curves | Interactive digital twin rotations; click-to-zoom on ESP/rod pump failures |
| Tank/Inventory Levels | Crude oil, gasoline/diesel, chemicals | Progress bars, 3D tank models | Animated fill levels with overflow alerts |
| Emissions/Safety | NOx/SOx/VOC, flaring quantification; geofenced personnel tracking | Pie charts, geospatial maps | Thermal imagery animations for leak/fire risks |
| Production KPIs | Throughput, yield efficiency, recovery factor | KPI cards, trend lines | Reservoir optimization feedback loops with iterative animations |

#### Graphics, Animations, and Video Game-Like Screens
- **3D Digital Twins**: Immersive models of wells, refinery units (e.g., new Crude Distillation Unit at 225k bpd). Use photorealistic rendering from CAD/scans; simulate scenarios like lateral movement or valve failures.



- **Animations**: Real-time machinery visuals (e.g., pump efficiency from power curves; steam/gas injection). Implement with JavaScript libraries like Three.js for WebGL-based interactions; mimic video games with pan/zoom/rotate controls.
- **Interactive Elements**: Operator-in-the-loop: Click to validate AI setpoints; drill-down from overview to asset-level views. Dark mode for low-light ops; notes/schematics pop-ups.
- **Examples from Industry**: Inspired by Aramco-style dashboards: Trellis charts for multi-well monitoring; holographic 3D projections for pipeline integrity.

#### Technical Requirements for Demo Web App
- **Frontend**: HTML5/CSS3/Angular for responsive UI; Chart.js/D3.js for charts; Three.js for 3D animations/digital twins.
- **Backend**: Node.js/GraphQL for data ingestion; simulate real-time with WebSockets (no actual SCADA for demo).
- **Data Simulation**: Use dummy datasets for metrics; integrate Polygon/Coingecko if needed for energy pricing.
- **Tools/Tech Stack**: Cloud-hosted (AWS/Azure); mobile-compatible; secure with RBAC mocks.
- **Development Timeline**: Quick prototype: 3-5 days for MVP (static animations); add interactions by Monday/Tuesday.
- **Risks/Mitigations**: Data quality – Use phased validation; resistance – Include training sims; cyber – Mock isolated zones.

#### ROI and Pilot Plan
- **Value Proposition**: OPEX reductions via predictive alerts; ESG alignment with emissions dashboards.
- **Phased Demo**: Phase 1: Sensor audit sim; Phase 2: Dashboard setup; Phase 3: Scale to refinery MES.
- **Next Steps**: Joint review; integrate BAPCO-specific units (e.g., 1RHCU at 65k bpd).
